## Abstract
FitLit is an activity tracker that shows a user's individual activity/fitness data, along with that user's data in relation to a database of other user's fitness/data. A major focus of this project was creating classes and testing those classes via test driven development.

## Screenshots of the App
 _The styling for some of the cards aren't styled, see "Issues/ Like to Have"_

## Installation Instructions
* `git clone` this repository
* `cd <directory>` change into the directory
* `npm install` to install dependencies and packages used for this project

## Issues/ Like to Have
* The styling for two of the cards (the card showing the activity and the card showing all the days a user exceeded their step goal) still need to be completed. 
* The styling needs to be adjusted so that a user's data doesn't affect the style regardless of the size of their data being dispaleyd.
* The current date should be shown somewhere on the page.
